# OUTDATED
This was my original portfolio that I made after my first few months of learning how to code.

# My Portfolio
This is a portfolio that displays everything I am capable of doing with software development. As of right now, it has a total of 5 different projects, 2 of them being our unit projects.

## Usage
The design around my portfolio site is pretty simple. The only navigation thing the user should have to worry about is the project dropdown at the top. Simply click the dropdown and it will show you the different projects available. The projects tab will change according to which project was chosen from the dropdown.
