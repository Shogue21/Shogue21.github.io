# Project Proposal
## Description and Motivation
This project exists to be my personal portfolio. The portfolio will clearly and effectively showcase my skills as a software developer. 
Users will be able to view the website with ease on any platform and easily navigate the site.

Below is my design plan for the website. The idea is to keep everything in one central place so that the user does not have to try to scroll through a bunch of things to find whatever they need.
This will work by the user choosing which project they would like to view with the dropdown menu at the top right of their screen.

## Prior Art
My design will be similar to a past BCCA student's:

Shedlia Freeman - https://sfreeman99.netlify.app/

Her design is similar to mine because it is compact, allowing the user to find everything they need without having to scroll through the website.

## Core User Workflows
Users should be able to see all the information in one place and be able to choose between which project to view. The site will default show the second unit project.
My portfolio should show my skills in Python, Go, HTML, and CSS.

## Daily Goals
### Tuesday - General Format:
The portfolio should have its general layout. This means the header should be set up, as well as the grid and everything for the body.
At this point, there will probably not be much information to see, but the layout should be visable to the user.

### Wednesday - Adding Content:
The portfolio should now have most, if not all, of the information it has to offer. Everything should be in place with the design plan.
The user should be able to see a picture of me, my name, my skills/coding languages, my contact information, and the about me section.
The only thing that may not be done at this point should be the ability to view the projects.

### Thursday - Finishing touches:
On the final day of creating the portfolio, the user should now be able to view and change between all of the available projects with a dropdown menu on the header.
The rest of the day should be spent on putting finishing touches from a design perspective. This means that additional CSS should be creating to make the viewing experience more pleasureable.
Most of the time spent will probably be on ensuring that the portfolio is easily viewable on mobile devices.
